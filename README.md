# NewspaperParser
Extract objects from newspaper archives (images, illustrations etc.)

Many newspaper archives are available online. Beyond simple OCR processing it's quite useful to be able to extract cropped contents from the scans.

## What can it extract?

* illustrations (adverts etc.)
* photography (portraits, landscapes etc.)
* maps (all sorts)
* tables

## The model

I trained a COCO model using just a few dozen custom labelled images.
